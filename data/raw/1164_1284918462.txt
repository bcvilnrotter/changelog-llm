<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI''') refers to the capability of [[computer|computational systems]] to perform tasks typically associated with [[human intelligence]], such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a [[field of research]] in [[computer science]] that develops and studies methods and [[software]] that enable machines to [[machine perception|perceive their environment]] and use [[machine learning|learning]] and [[intelligence]] to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1–4}} Such machines may be called AIs.

<!-- APPLICATIONS -->
High-profile [[applications of AI]] include advanced [[web search engine]]s (e.g., [[Google Search]]); [[recommendation systems]] (used by [[YouTube]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], and [[Netflix]]); [[virtual assistant]]s (e.g., [[Google Assistant]], [[Siri]], and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]]); [[autonomous vehicles]] (e.g., [[Waymo]]); [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative]] and [[Computational creativity|creative]] tools (e.g., [[ChatGPT]] and [[AI art]]); and [[Superintelligence|superhuman]] play and analysis in [[strategy game]]s (e.g., [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's [[AI effect|not labeled AI anymore]]."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/07/24/ai.bostrom/ AI set to exceed human brain power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219001624/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/07/24/ai.bostrom/|date=2008-02-19}} CNN.com (July 26, 2006)</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael |date=2019 |title=Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

<!-- GOALS AND TOOLS: SCOPE OF AI -->
Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], [[knowledge representation]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[natural language processing]], [[Machine perception|perception]], and support for [[robotics]].{{Efn|name="Problems of AI"}} [[Artificial general intelligence|General intelligence]]—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.<ref name="Artificial general intelligence" /> To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including [[state space search|search]] and [[mathematical optimization]], [[formal logic]], [[artificial neural network]]s, and methods based on [[statistics]], [[operations research]], and [[economics]].{{Efn|name="Tools of AI"}} AI also draws upon [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and other fields.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§1.2}}.</ref>

<!-- HISTORY AND ETHICS -->
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,<ref name="Dartmouth workshop"/> and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout [[History of artificial intelligence|its history]],<ref name="Succ1"/><ref name="Fund01"/> followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as [[AI winter]]s.<ref name="First AI Winter"/><ref name="Second AI Winter"/> Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when [[deep learning]] outperformed previous AI techniques.<ref name="Deep learning revolution"/> This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the [[transformer architecture]],{{Sfnp|Toews|2023}} and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing [[Progress in artificial intelligence|progress]] in what has become known as the [[AI boom]]. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the [[AI risk|risks of AI]] and [[AI aftermath scenarios|its long-term effects]] in the future, prompting discussions about [[Regulation of artificial intelligence|regulatory policies]] to ensure the [[AI safety|safety and benefits of the technology]].

== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.{{Efn|name="Problems of AI"|This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998}}}}

=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical [[Deductive reasoning|deductions]].<ref>Problem-solving, puzzle solving, game playing, and deduction: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 3–5}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 6}} ([[constraint satisfaction]]), {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=chpt. 2, 3, 7, 9}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|loc=chpt. 3, 4, 6, 8}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 7–12}}</ref> By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref>Uncertain reasoning: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 12–18}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=345–395}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=333–381}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 7–12}}</ref>

Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.<ref name="Intractability and efficiency and the combinatorial explosion">[[Intractably|Intractability and efficiency]] and the [[combinatorial explosion]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=21}}</ref> Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name="Psychological evidence of the prevalence of sub">Psychological evidence of the prevalence of sub-symbolic reasoning and knowledge: {{Harvtxt|Kahneman|2011}}, {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}, {{Harvtxt|Wason|Shapiro|1966}}, {{Harvtxt|Kahneman|Slovic|Tversky|1982}}</ref> Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

=== Knowledge representation ===
[[File:General Formal Ontology.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]

[[Knowledge representation]] and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref>[[Knowledge representation]] and [[knowledge engineering]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 10}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=23–46, 69–81, 169–233, 235–277, 281–298, 319–345}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–243}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.1–17.4, 18}}</ref> allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,{{Sfnp|Smoliar|Zhang|1994}} scene interpretation,{{Sfnp|Neumann|Möller|2008}} clinical decision support,{{Sfnp|Kuperman|Reichley|Bailey|2006}} knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large [[database]]s),{{Sfnp|McGarry|2005}} and other areas.{{Sfnp|Bertini|Del Bimbo|Torniai|2006}}

A [[knowledge base]] is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=272}} Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;<ref>Representing categories and relations: [[Semantic network]]s, [[description logic]]s, [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] (including [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frames]], and [[Scripts (artificial intelligence)|scripts]]): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§10.2 & 10.5}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=174–177}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=248–258}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 18.3}}</ref> situations, events, states, and time;<ref>Representing events and time:[[Situation calculus]], [[event calculus]], [[fluent calculus]] (including solving the [[frame problem]]): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§10.3}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=281–298}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 18.2}}</ref> causes and effects;<ref>[[Causality#Causal calculus|Causal calculus]]: {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=335–337}}</ref> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref>Representing knowledge about knowledge: Belief calculus, [[modal logic]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§10.4}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=275–277}}</ref> [[default reasoning]] (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);<ref name="Default reasoning">[[Default reasoning]], [[Frame problem]], [[default logic]], [[non-monotonic logic]]s, [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]], [[closed world assumption]], [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§10.6}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=248–256, 323–335}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=335–363}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=~18.3.3}}
(Poole ''et al.'' places abduction under "default reasoning". Luger ''et al.'' places this under "uncertain reasoning").</ref> and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);<ref name="Breadth of commonsense knowledge">Breadth of commonsense knowledge: {{Harvtxt|Lenat|Guha|1989|loc=Introduction}}, {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|pp=113–114}}, {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988|p=13}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=241, 385, 982}} ([[qualification problem]])</ref> and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).<ref name="Psychological evidence of the prevalence of sub"/> There is also the difficulty of [[knowledge acquisition]], the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.{{Efn|It is among the reasons that [[expert system]]s proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.{{Sfnp|Newquist|1994|p=296}}{{Sfnp|Crevier|1993|pp=204–208}}}}

=== Planning and decision-making ===
An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A [[rational agent]] has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.{{Efn|
"Rational agent" is general term used in [[economics]], [[philosophy]] and theoretical artificial intelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program.
}}{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=528}} In [[automated planning]], the agent has a specific goal.<ref>[[Automated planning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 11}}.</ref> In [[automated decision-making]], the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "[[utility]]") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "[[expected utility]]": the [[utility]] of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.<ref>[[Automated decision making]], [[Decision theory]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 16–18}}.</ref>

In [[Automated planning and scheduling#classical planning|classical planning]], the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.<ref>[[Automated planning and scheduling#classical planning|Classical planning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 11.2}}.</ref> In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.<ref>Sensorless or "conformant" planning, contingent planning, replanning (a.k.a online planning): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 11.5}}.</ref>

In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with [[inverse reinforcement learning]]), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.<ref>Uncertain preferences: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 16.7}}
[[Inverse reinforcement learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 22.6}}</ref> [[Information value theory]] can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.<ref>[[Information value theory]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 16.6}}.</ref> The space of possible future actions and situations is typically [[intractably]] large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.

A [[Markov decision process]] has a [[Finite-state machine|transition model]] that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a [[reward function]] that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A [[Reinforcement learning#Policy|policy]] associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by [[policy iteration|iteration]]), be [[heuristic]], or it can be learned.<ref>[[Markov decision process]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 17}}.</ref>

[[Game theory]] describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.<ref>[[Game theory]] and multi-agent decision theory: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 18}}.</ref>

=== Learning ===
[[Machine learning]] is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.<ref>[[machine learning|Learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 19–22}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=397–438}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=385–542}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 3.3, 10.3, 17.5, 20}}</ref> It has been a part of AI from the beginning.{{Efn
|[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]".{{Sfnp|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine".{{Sfnp|Solomonoff|1956}}
}}
[[File:Supervised and unsupervised learning.png|right|upright=1.4|frameless]]
There are several kinds of machine learning. [[Unsupervised learning]] analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.<ref>[[Unsupervised learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=653}} (definition), {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=738–740}} ([[cluster analysis]]), {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=846–860}} ([[word embedding]])</ref> [[Supervised learning]] requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: [[statistical classification|classification]] (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and [[Regression analysis|regression]] (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).<ref name="Supervised learning">[[Supervised learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§19.2}} (Definition), {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Chpt. 19–20}} (Techniques)</ref>

In [[reinforcement learning]], the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".<ref>[[Reinforcement learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 22}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=442–449}}</ref> [[Transfer learning]] is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.<ref>[[Transfer learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=281}}, {{Harvtxt|The Economist|2016}}</ref> [[Deep learning]] is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired [[artificial neural networks]] for all of these types of learning.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Artificial Intelligence (AI): What Is AI and How Does It Work? {{!}} Built In |url=https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=builtin.com}}</ref>

=== Natural language processing ===
<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->
[[Natural language processing]] (NLP)<ref>[[Natural language processing]] (NLP): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 23–24}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=91–104}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=591–632}}</ref> allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as [[English (language)|English]]. Specific problems include [[speech recognition]], [[speech synthesis]], [[machine translation]], [[information extraction]], [[information retrieval]] and [[question answering]].<ref>Subproblems of [[Natural language processing|NLP]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=849–850}}</ref>

Early work, based on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[generative grammar]] and [[semantic network]]s, had difficulty with [[word-sense disambiguation]]{{Efn|See {{Section link|AI winter|Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966
}}}} unless restricted to small domains called "[[blocks world|micro-worlds]]" (due to the common sense knowledge problem<ref name="Breadth of commonsense knowledge"/>). [[Margaret Masterman]] believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that [[thesauri]] and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.

Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include [[word embedding]] (representing words, typically as [[Vector space|vectors]] encoding their meaning),{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=856–858}} [[transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]]s (a deep learning architecture using an [[Attention (machine learning)|attention]] mechanism),{{Sfnp|Dickson|2022}} and others.<ref>Modern statistical and deep learning approaches to [[Natural language processing|NLP]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 24}}, {{Harvtxt|Cambria|White|2014}}</ref> In 2019, [[generative pre-trained transformer]] (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,{{Sfnp|Vincent|2019}}{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=875–878}} and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the [[bar exam]], [[SAT]] test, [[GRE]] test, and many other real-world applications.{{Sfnp|Bushwick|2023}}

=== Perception ===<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->

[[Machine perception]] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input.<ref>[[Computer vision]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 25}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 6}}</ref>

The field includes [[speech recognition]],{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=849–850}} [[image classification]],{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=895–899}} [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], [[object recognition]],{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=899–901}}[[motion capture|object tracking]],{{Sfnp|Challa|Moreland|Mušicki|Evans|2011}} and [[robotic perception]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=931–938}}

=== Social intelligence ===
[[File:Kismet-IMG 6007-gradient.jpg|thumb|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]], a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.{{Sfnp|MIT AIL|2014}}]]

[[Affective computing]] is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human [[Affect (psychology)|feeling, emotion, and mood]].<ref>[[Affective computing]]: {{Harvtxt|Thro|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Edelson|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Tao|Tan|2005}}, {{Harvtxt|Scassellati|2002}}</ref> For example, some [[virtual assistant]]s are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate [[human–computer interaction]].

However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.{{Sfnp|Waddell|2018}} Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual [[sentiment analysis]] and, more recently, [[multimodal sentiment analysis]], wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.{{Sfnp|Poria|Cambria|Bajpai |Hussain|2017}}

=== General intelligence ===

A machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to [[human intelligence]].<ref name="Artificial general intelligence" >

== Techniques ==
AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.{{Efn|name="Tools of AI"|This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998}}}}

=== Search and optimization ===
AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.<ref>[[Search algorithm]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpts. 3–5}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=113–163}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=79–164, 193–219}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpts. 7–12}}</ref> There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: [[state space search]] and [[Local search (optimization)|local search]].

==== State space search ====
[[State space search]] searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.<ref>[[State space search]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 3}}</ref> For example, [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 11.2}}

[[Brute force search|Simple exhaustive searches]]<ref>[[Uninformed search]]es ([[breadth first search]], [[depth-first search]] and general [[state space search]]): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 3.4}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=113–132}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=79–121}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 8}}</ref> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[Search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes.<ref name="Intractability and efficiency and the combinatorial explosion"/> "[[Heuristics]]" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.<ref>[[Heuristic]] or informed searches (e.g., greedy [[Best-first search|best first]] and [[A* search algorithm|A*]]): {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 3.5}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=132–147}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|2017|loc=sect. 3.6}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=133–150}}</ref>

[[Adversarial search]] is used for [[game AI|game-playing]] programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a [[Game tree|tree]] of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.<ref>[[Adversarial search]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 5}}</ref>

==== Local search ====
[[File:Gradient descent.gif|class=skin-invert-image|thumb|Illustration of [[gradient descent]] for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the [[loss function]] (the height)]] [[Local search (optimization)|Local search]] uses [[mathematical optimization]] to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.<ref>[[Local search (optimization)|Local]] or "[[optimization]]" search: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 4}}</ref>

[[Gradient descent]] is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a [[loss function]]. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Singh Chauhan |first=Nagesh |date=December 18, 2020 |title=Optimization Algorithms in Neural Networks |url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/optimization-algorithms-in-neural-networks |access-date=2024-01-13 |website=KDnuggets}}</ref> through the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.

Another type of local search is [[evolutionary computation]], which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them, [[Artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation.<ref>[[Evolutionary computation]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 4.1.2}}</ref>

Distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).{{Sfnp|Merkle|Middendorf|2013}}

=== Logic ===
Formal [[logic]] is used for [[automatic reasoning|reasoning]] and [[knowledge representation]].<ref>[[Logic]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpts. 6–9}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=35–77}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 13–16}}</ref>
Formal logic comes in two main forms: [[propositional logic]] (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses [[logical connective]]s such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")<ref>[[Propositional logic]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 6}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=45–50}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 13}}</ref> and [[predicate logic]] (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s such as "''Every'' ''X'' is a ''Y''" and "There are ''some'' ''X''s that are ''Y''s").<ref>[[First-order logic]] and features such as [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 7}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=268–275}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=50–62}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 15}}</ref>

[[Deductive reasoning]] in logic is the process of [[logical proof|proving]] a new statement ([[Logical consequence|conclusion]]) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the [[premise]]s).<ref>[[Logical inference]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 10}}</ref> Proofs can be structured as proof [[tree structure|trees]], in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by [[inference rule]]s.

Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose [[leaf nodes]] are labelled by premises or [[axiom]]s. In the case of [[Horn clause]]s, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning [[Forward chaining|forwards]] from the premises or [[backward chaining|backwards]] from the problem.<ref>logical deduction as search: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sects. 9.3, 9.4}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=~46–52}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=62–73}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 4.2, 7.2}}</ref> In the more general case of the clausal form of [[first-order logic]], [[resolution (logic)|resolution]] is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.<ref>[[Resolution (logic)|Resolution]] and [[unification (computer science)|unification]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc= sections 7.5.2, 9.2, 9.5}}</ref>

Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], and therefore [[Intractable problem|intractable]]. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the [[logic programming]] language [[Prolog]], is [[Turing complete]]. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other [[symbolic programming]] languages.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Warren |first1=D.H. |last2=Pereira |first2=L.M. |last3=Pereira |first3=F. |date=1977 |title=Prolog-the language and its implementation compared with Lisp |journal=[[ACM SIGPLAN Notices]] |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=109–115 |doi=10.1145/872734.806939}}</ref>

[[Fuzzy logic]] assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.<ref>Fuzzy logic: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=214, 255, 459}}, {{Harvtxt|Scientific American|1999}}</ref>

[[Non-monotonic logic]]s, including logic programming with [[negation as failure]], are designed to handle [[default reasoning]].<ref name="Default reasoning"/> Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.

=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===
[[File:SimpleBayesNet.svg|class=skin-invert-image|thumb|upright=1.7|A simple [[Bayesian network]], with the associated [[conditional probability table]]s]]
Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name="Stoch">Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 12–18, 20}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=345–395}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=165–191, 333–381}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref> Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref>[[decision theory]] and [[decision analysis]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 16–18}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=381–394}}</ref> and [[information value theory]].<ref>[[Information value theory]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 16.6}}</ref> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref>[[Markov decision process]]es and dynamic [[decision network]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 17}}</ref> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name="Stochastic temporal models"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref>[[Game theory]] and [[mechanism design]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]]<ref>Statistical learning methods and [[Classifier (mathematics)|classifiers]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 20}},</ref> are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using [[supervised learning]]. Each pattern (also called an "[[random variate|observation]]") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a [[data set]]. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name="Supervised learning"/>

There are many kinds of classifiers in use.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ciaramella |first1=Alberto |author-link=Alberto Ciaramella |title=Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: from data analysis to generative AI |last2=Ciaramella |first2=Marco |date=2024 |publisher=Intellisemantic Editions |isbn=978-8-8947-8760-3}}</ref> The [[decision tree]] is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.<ref>[[Alternating decision tree|Decision tree]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 19.3}}, {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015|p=88}}</ref> [[K-nearest neighbor]] algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and [[Kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.<ref>[[Nonparametric statistics|Non-parameteric]] learning models such as [[K-nearest neighbor]] and [[support vector machines]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 19.7}}, {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015|p=187}} (k-nearest neighbor)

The [[naive Bayes classifier]] is reportedly the "most widely used learner"{{Sfnp|Domingos|2015|p=152}} at Google, due in part to its scalability.<ref>[[Naive Bayes classifier]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 12.6}}, {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015|p=152}}</ref>
[[Artificial neural network|Neural networks]] are also used as classifiers.<ref name="Neural networks"/>

=== Artificial neural networks ===
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|right|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]

An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as [[artificial neurons]], which loosely model the [[neurons]] in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the [[Weighting|weight]] crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.<ref name="Neural networks">Neural networks: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 21}}, {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}}</ref>

Learning algorithms for neural networks use [[local search (optimization)|local search]] to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.<ref>Gradient calculation in computational graphs, [[backpropagation]], [[automatic differentiation]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 21.2}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=467–474}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 3.3}}</ref> Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and [[Pattern recognition|find patterns]] in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.<ref>[[Universal approximation theorem]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=752}}
The theorem: {{Harvtxt|Cybenko|1988}}, {{Harvtxt|Hornik|Stinchcombe|White|1989}}</ref>

In [[feedforward neural network]]s the signal passes in only one direction.<ref>[[Feedforward neural network]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 21.1}}</ref> [[Recurrent neural network]]s feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. [[Long short term memory]] is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.<ref>[[Recurrent neural network]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 21.6}}</ref> [[Perceptron]]s<ref>[[Perceptron]]s: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=21, 22, 683, 22}}</ref> use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning<ref name="Deep learning"/> uses multiple layers. [[Convolutional neural network]]s strengthen the connection between neurons that are "close" to each other—this is especially important in [[image processing]], where a local set of neurons must [[edge detection|identify an "edge"]] before the network can identify an object.<ref>[[Convolutional neural networks]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=sect. 21.3}}</ref>

=== Deep learning ===
[[File:AI hierarchy.svg|thumb|upright]]
[[Deep learning]]<ref name="Deep learning">[[Deep learning]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 21}}, {{Harvtxt|Goodfellow|Bengio|Courville|2016}}, {{Harvtxt|Hinton ''et al.''|2016}}, {{Harvtxt|Schmidhuber|2015}}</ref> uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in [[image processing]], lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.{{Sfnp|Deng|Yu|2014|pp=199–200}}

Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]], [[image classification]],{{Sfnp|Ciresan|Meier|Schmidhuber|2012}} and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=750}} The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s){{Efn|
Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by:
[[Warren S. McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] (1943){{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=17}}

[[Frank Rosenblatt]](1957);{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}
[[Oliver Selfridge]] (1959);{{Sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=sect. 5}}

[[John Joseph Hopfield]] (1982).{{Sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=sect. 7}}
Precursors to backpropagation were developed by:

[[Arthur E. Bryson]] (1962);{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}

[And] our computers were millions of times too slow."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=22}}</ref>}}

===GPT===
[[Generative pre-trained transformer]]s (GPT) are [[large language model]]s (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large [[corpus of text]] that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next [[Lexical analysis|token]] (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "[[Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|hallucinations]]", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in [[chatbot]]s, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.{{Sfnp|Smith|2023}}<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 November 2023 |title=Explained: Generative AI |url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109}}</ref>

According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum]], it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation."<ref>M.

===Agents===
Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including [[virtual assistant]]s, [[chatbots]], [[autonomous vehicles]], [[Video game console|game-playing systems]], and [[industrial robotics]]. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Poole |first1=David |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009258227 |title=Artificial Intelligence, Foundations of Computational Agents |last2=Mackworth |first2=Alan |date=2023 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-0092-5819-7 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1017/9781009258227 |access-date=5 October 2024 |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005165650/https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/artificial-intelligence/C113F6CE284AB00F5489EBA5A59B93B7#overview |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |publisher=Pearson |date=2020 |isbn=978-0-1346-1099-3 |edition=4th}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-24 |title=Why agents are the next frontier of generative AI |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai |access-date=2024-08-10 |website=McKinsey Digital |archive-date=3 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241003212335/https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai |url-status=live }}</ref>

In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct [[predictive analytics]], classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.

Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights." For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.

=== Risks and harm ===
==== Privacy and copyright ====
{{Further|Information privacy|Artificial intelligence and copyright}}

Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about [[privacy]], [[surveillance]] and [[copyright]].

<!-- PRIVACY PROBLEM -->
AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.

Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.{{Sfnp|GAO|2022}} For example, in order to build [[speech recognition]] algorithms, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed [[temporary worker]]s to listen to and transcribe some of them.{{Sfnp|Valinsky|2019}} Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a [[necessary evil]] to those for whom it is clearly [[unethical]] and a violation of the [[right to privacy]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=991}}

<!-- PRIVACY SOLUTIONS -->
AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as [[data aggregation]], [[de-identification]] and [[differential privacy]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=991–992}} Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as [[Cynthia Dwork]], have begun to view privacy in terms of [[fairness (machine learning)|fairness]]. [[Brian Christian]] wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=63}}

<!-- COPYRIGHT AND GENERATIVE AI -->
Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "[[fair use]]". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".{{Sfnp|Vincent|2022}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kopel |first=Matthew |title=Copyright Services: Fair Use |url=https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/fair-use |access-date=2024-04-26 |website=Cornell University Library |archive-date=26 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240926194057/https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/fair-use |url-status=live }}</ref> Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "[[robots.txt]]" file.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Burgess |first=Matt |title=How to Stop Your Data From Being Used to Train AI |url=https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai |access-date=2024-04-26 |magazine=Wired |issn=1059-1028 |archive-date=3 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241003180100/https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2023, leading authors (including [[John Grisham]] and [[Jonathan Franzen]]) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.{{Sfnp|Reisner|2023}}{{Sfnp|Alter|Harris|2023}} Another discussed approach is to envision a separate ''[[sui generis]]'' system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Getting the Innovation Ecosystem Ready for AI.

Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Halper |first1=Evan |last2=O'Donovan |first2=Caroline |date=21 June 2024 |title=AI is exhausting the power grid.

A 2024 [[Goldman Sachs]] Research Paper, ''AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge'', found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...." and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davenport |first=Carly |title=AI Data Centers and the Coming YS Power Demand Surge |url=https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf |website=Goldman Sachs |access-date=5 October 2024 |archive-date=26 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240726080428/https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid.

In September 2024, [[Microsoft]] announced an agreement with [[Constellation Energy]] to re-open the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced.

==== Misinformation ====
{{See also|YouTube#Moderation and offensive content}}

[[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and others use [[recommender system]]s to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of [[mathematical optimization|maximizing]] user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose [[misinformation]], [[conspiracy theories]], and extreme [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into [[filter bubbles]] where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.{{Sfnp|Nicas|2018}} This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Rainie |first1=Lee |last2=Keeter |first2=Scott |last3=Perrin |first3=Andrew |date=July 22, 2019 |title=Trust and Distrust in America |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240222000601/https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america |archive-date=Feb 22, 2024 |website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society.

In 2022, [[generative AI]] began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.{{Sfnp|Williams|2023}} AI pioneer [[Geoffrey Hinton]] expressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks.{{Sfnp|Taylor|Hern|2023}}

====Algorithmic bias and fairness====
{{Main|Algorithmic bias|Fairness (machine learning)}}

Machine learning applications will be [[algorithmic bias|biased]]{{Efn|In statistics, a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of [[Fairness (machine learning)|fairness]], it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense.<ref name="Samuel-2022"/>}} if they learn from biased data.{{Sfnp|Rose|2023}} The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.{{Sfnp|CNA|2019}} Bias can be introduced by the way [[training data]] is selected and by the way a model is deployed.{{Sfnp|Goffrey|2008|p=17}}{{Sfnp|Rose|2023}} If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously [[harm]] people (as it can in [[health equity|medicine]], [[credit rating|finance]], [[recruitment]], [[public housing|housing]] or [[policing]]) then the algorithm may cause [[discrimination]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Berdahl|Baker|Mann|Osoba|2023}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffrey|2008|p=17}}; {{Harvtxt|Rose|2023}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}</ref> The field of [[fairness (machine learning)|fairness]] studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.

On June 28, 2015, [[Google Photos]]'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=25}} a problem called "sample size disparity".{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}} Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling ''anything'' as a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.{{Sfnp|Grant|Hill|2023}}

[[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]] is a commercial program widely used by [[U.S. court]]s to assess the likelihood of a [[defendant]] becoming a [[recidivist]]. In 2016, [[Julia Angwin]] at [[ProPublica]] discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.{{Sfnp|Larson|Angwin|2016}} In 2017, several researchers{{Efn|Including [[Jon Kleinberg]] ([[Cornell University]]), Sendhil Mullainathan ([[University of Chicago]]), Cynthia Chouldechova ([[Carnegie Mellon]]) and Sam Corbett-Davis ([[Stanford]]){{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=67–70}}}} showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=67–70}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=993–994}}</ref>

A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}; {{Harvtxt|Lipartito|2011|p=36}}; {{Harvtxt|Goodman|Flaxman|2017|p=6}}; {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=39–40, 65}}</ref> Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=65}}.</ref>

Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as ''recommendations'', some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=994}}; {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=40, 80–81}}</ref> Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be ''better'' than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.{{Efn|Moritz Hardt (a director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems]]) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=80}}</ref>}}

Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}

There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is [[Distributive justice|distributive fairness]], which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative [[stereotype]]s or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with [[anti-discrimination law]]s.<ref name="Samuel-2022">{{Cite web |last=Samuel |first=Sigal |date=2022-04-19 |title=Why it's so damn hard to make AI fair and unbiased |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence |access-date=2024-07-24 |website=Vox |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005170153/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence |url-status=live }}</ref>

At its 2022 [[ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency|Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency]] (ACM FAccT 2022), the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.{{Dubious|date=July 2024|reason=Depending on what is meant by "free of bias", it may be impossible in practice to demonstrate it. Additionally, the study evaluates the priors (initial assumptions) of the robots, rather than their decision-making in scenarios where there is a correct choice. For example, it may not be sexist to have the prior that most doctors are males (it's actually an accurate statistical prior in the world we currently live in, so the bias may arguably be to not have this prior). If forced to choose which one is the doctor based solely on gender, a rational person seeking to maximize the number of correct answers would choose the man 100% of the time. The real issue arises when such priors lead to significant discrimination.}}{{Sfnp|Dockrill|2022}}

==== Lack of transparency ====
{{See also|Explainable AI|Algorithmic transparency|Right to explanation}}
Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.{{Sfnp|Sample|2017}} Particularly with [[deep neural networks]], in which there are a large amount of non-[[linear]] relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 June 2023 |title=Black Box AI |url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34940/black-box-ai |access-date=5 October 2024 |archive-date=15 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240615100800/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34940/black-box-ai |url-status=live }}</ref>

It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a [[ruler]] as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=110}} Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=88–91}}

People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=83}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=997}}</ref> Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.{{Efn|When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.}} Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=91}}

[[DARPA]] established the [[Explainable Artificial Intelligence|XAI]] ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|p=83}}

Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.{{Sfnp|Verma|2021}} LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.{{Sfnp|Rothman|2020}} [[Multitask learning]] provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=105–108}} [[Deconvolution]], [[DeepDream]] and other [[generative AI|generative]] methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.{{Sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=108–112}} For [[generative pre-trained transformer]]s, [[Anthropic]] developed a technique based on [[dictionary learning]] that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ropek |first=Lucas |date=2024-05-21 |title=New Anthropic Research Sheds Light on AI's 'Black Box' |url=https://gizmodo.com/new-anthropic-research-sheds-light-on-ais-black-box-1851491333 |access-date=2024-05-23 |website=Gizmodo |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005170309/https://gizmodo.com/new-anthropic-research-sheds-light-on-ais-black-box-1851491333 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====
{{Main|Lethal autonomous weapon|Artificial intelligence arms race|AI safety}}

Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to [[bad actor]]s, such as [[authoritarian|authoritarian governments]], [[terrorist]]s, [[criminals]] or [[rogue states]].

A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.{{Efn|This is the [[United Nations]]' definition, and includes things like [[land mines]] as well.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=989}}}} Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially [[weapons of mass destruction]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=987–990}} Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially [[murder|kill an innocent person]].{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=987–990}} In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]], however the [[United States]] and others disagreed.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=988}} By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Robitzski|2018}}; {{Harvtxt|Sainato|2015}}</ref>

AI tools make it easier for [[Authoritarian|authoritarian governments]] to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. [[Facial recognition system|Face]] and [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] allow widespread [[surveillance]]. [[Machine learning]], operating this data, can [[classifier (machine learning)|classify]] potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. [[Recommendation systems]] can precisely target [[propaganda]] and [[misinformation]] for maximum effect. [[Deepfakes]] and [[generative AI]] aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian [[technocracy|centralized decision making]] more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as [[market (economics)|market]]s. It lowers the cost and difficulty of [[digital warfare]] and [[spyware|advanced spyware]].{{Sfnp|Harari|2018}} All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI [[facial recognition system]]s are already being used for [[mass surveillance]] in China.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=Chris |last2=Mozur |first2=Paul |date=22 May 2019 |title=How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-date=25 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191125180459/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=3 May 2019 |title=Security lapse exposed a Chinese smart city surveillance system |url=https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307203740/https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_c8562b93-9863-4915-8523-6c7b930a3efc |archive-date=7 March 2021 |access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref>

There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.{{Sfnp|Urbina|Lentzos|Invernizzi|Ekins|2022}}

==== Technological unemployment ====
{{Main|Workplace impact of artificial intelligence|Technological unemployment}}

Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.<ref name="E">E. McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away?

<!-- TOPIC: ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT -->
In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ford|Colvin|2015}};{{Harvtxt|McGaughey|2022}}</ref> A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term [[unemployment]], but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if [[productivity]] gains are [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributed]].{{Sfnp|IGM Chicago|2017}} Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".{{Efn|See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.{{Sfnp|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}}}<ref>{{Harvtxt|Lohr|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Frey|Osborne|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}</ref> The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.<ref name="E"/> In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zhou |first=Viola |date=2023-04-11 |title=AI is already taking video game illustrators' jobs in China |url=https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-china-video-game-layoffs |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Rest of World |archive-date=21 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240221131748/https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-china-video-game-layoffs/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Justin |date=2023-04-11 |title=China's game art industry reportedly decimated by growing AI use |url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/china-s-game-art-industry-reportedly-decimated-ai-art-use |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Game Developer |archive-date=17 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230817010519/https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/china-s-game-art-industry-reportedly-decimated-ai-art-use |url-status=live }}</ref>

<!-- TOPIC: WHICH JOBS ARE AT RISK? -->
Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; ''[[The Economist]]'' stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".{{Sfnp|Morgenstern|2015}} Jobs at extreme risk range from [[paralegal]]s to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mahdawi|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Thompson|2014}}</ref>

From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tarnoff |first=Ben |date=4 August 2023 |title=Lessons from Eliza |work=[[The Guardian Weekly]] |pages=34–39}}</ref>

==== Existential risk ====
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial intelligence}}

It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] stated, "[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]".{{Sfnp|Cellan-Jones|2014}} This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character.{{Efn|Sometimes called a "[[robopocalypse]]"{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1001}}}} These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.

First, AI does not require human-like [[sentience]] to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argued that if one gives ''almost any'' goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip factory manager]]).{{Sfnp|Bostrom|2014}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."{{Sfnp|Russell|2019}} In order to be safe for humanity, a [[superintelligence]] would have to be genuinely [[AI alignment|aligned]] with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Müller|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2015}}.</ref>

Second, [[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like [[ideologies]], [[law]], [[government]], [[money]] and the [[economy]] are built on [[language]]; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe.

=== Ethical machines and alignment ===
{{Main|Machine ethics|AI safety|Friendly artificial intelligence|Artificial moral agents|Human Compatible}}

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.{{Sfnp|Yudkowsky|2008}}

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.{{Sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,{{Sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
and was founded at an [[AAAI]] symposium in 2005.{{Sfnp|AAAI|2014}}

Other approaches include [[Wendell Wallach]]'s "artificial moral agents"{{Sfnp|Wallach|2010}} and [[Stuart J. Russell]]'s [[Human Compatible#Russell's three principles|three principles]] for developing provably beneficial machines.{{Sfnp|Russell|2019|p=173}}

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=9}}<ref name="Clarendon Press-2004"/> This, along with concurrent discoveries in [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]] and [[neurobiology]], led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".{{Efn|"Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time.{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=9}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Google books ngram |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+brain&year_start=1930&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3 |access-date=5 October 2024 |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005170209/https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+brain&year_start=1930&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,<ref>AI's immediate precursors: {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=51–107}}, {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|pp=27–32}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=8–17}}, {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988|p=3}}</ref> such as [[Warren McCullouch|McCullouch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]] design for "artificial neurons" in 1943,{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=17}} and Turing's influential 1950 paper '[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]', which introduced the [[Turing test]] and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible.<ref name="Turing"/><ref name="Clarendon Press-2004">{{Cite book |title=The Essential Turing: the ideas that gave birth to the computer age |date=2004 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-1982-5079-7 |editor-last=Copeland |editor-first=J. |location=Oxford, England}}</ref>

The field of AI research was founded at [[Dartmouth workshop|a workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956.{{Efn|

<!-- Optimism of the 60s and first AI "winter": 1974 -->
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.{{Sfnp|Newquist|1994|pp=86–86}} In 1965 [[Herbert A.

<!-- 1980s and second AI winter -->
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of [[expert system]]s,<ref>[[Expert systems]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=23, 292}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}, {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}, {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|pp=145–162, 197–203}}, {{Harvtxt|Newquist|1994|pp=155–183}}</ref> a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.

<!-- Embodied robotics, uncertain reasoning, and connectionism in the 1980s -->
Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level [[symbolic AI|symbols]] to represent [[mental objects]] like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]],{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=24}} and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.{{Sfnp|Nilsson|1998|p=7}} [[Rodney Brooks]] rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.{{Efn|
[[embodied mind|Embodied]] approaches to AI{{Sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=454–462}} were championed by [[Hans Moravec]]{{Sfnp|Moravec|1988}} and [[Rodney Brooks]]{{Sfnp|Brooks|1990}} and went by many names: [[Nouvelle AI]].{{Sfnp|Brooks|1990}} [[Developmental robotics]].<ref>[[Developmental robotics]]: {{Harvtxt|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}, {{Harvtxt|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}, {{Harvtxt|Oudeyer|2010}}</ref>
}} [[Judea Pearl]], [[Lofti Zadeh]], and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.<ref name="Stoch"/>{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=25}} But the most important development was the revival of "[[connectionism]]", including neural network research, by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and others.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|pp=214–215}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=24, 26}}</ref> In 1990, [[Yann LeCun]] successfully showed that [[convolutional neural networks]] can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=26}}

<!-- 1990s: narrow, formal AI and its detractors -->
AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "[[narrow AI|narrow]]" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as [[statistics]], [[economics]] and [[mathematical optimization|mathematics]]).<ref name="Formal and narrow methods adopted in the 1990s">[[#Neat vs. scruffy|Formal]] and [[#Narrow vs. general AI|narrow]] methods adopted in the 1990s: {{Harvtxt |Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=24–26}}, {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=486–487}}</ref> By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as the [[AI effect]]).<ref>AI widely used in the late 1990s: {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005|p=265}}, {{Harvtxt|NRC|1999|pp=216–222}}, {{Harvtxt|Newquist|1994|pp=189–201}}</ref>
However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of [[artificial general intelligence]] (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.<ref name="Artificial general intelligence"/>

<!--DEEP LEARNING BOOM 2012–present-->

For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.{{Efn|Matteo Wong wrote in [[The Atlantic]]: "Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called "deep learning". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another."{{Sfnp|Wong|2023}}}}
Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ([[Moore's law|faster computers]],<ref>[[Moore's Law]] and AI: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=14, 27}}</ref> [[graphics processing unit]]s, [[cloud computing]]{{Sfnp|Clark|2015b}}) and access to [[big data|large amounts of data]]<ref>[[Big data]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=26}}</ref> (including curated datasets,{{Sfnp|Clark|2015b}} such as [[ImageNet]]). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.{{Efn|Jack Clark wrote in [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]: "After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at [[Google]] increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015.{{Sfnp|Clark|2015b}}}} The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.{{Sfnp|UNESCO|2021}}

=== Defining artificial intelligence ===
{{See also|Turing test|Intelligent agent|Dartmouth workshop|Synthetic intelligence}}
[[Alan Turing]] wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"{{Sfnp|Turing|1950|p=1}} He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".{{Sfnp|Turing|1950|p=1}} He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.<ref name="Turing">Turing's original publication of the [[Turing test]] in "[[Computing machinery and intelligence]]": {{Harvtxt|Turing|1950}}

[[File:Weakness of Turing test 1.svg|thumb|The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Kirk-Giannini |first1=Cameron Domenico |last2=Goldstein |first2=Simon |date=2023-10-16 |title=AI is closer than ever to passing the Turing test for 'intelligence'.

[[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Norvig]] agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1–4}} However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "[[Aeronautics|Aeronautical engineering]] texts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like [[pigeon]]s that they can fool other pigeons.{{' "}}{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=3}} AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".{{Sfnp|Maker|2006}}

McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world".{{Sfnp|McCarthy|1999}} Another AI founder, [[Marvin Minsky]], similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems".{{Sfnp|Minsky|1986}} The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1–4}} These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.

Another definition has been adopted by Google,<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? |url=https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230731114802/https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence |archive-date=31 July 2023 |access-date=16 October 2023 |website=[[Google Cloud Platform]]}}</ref> a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.

=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===

No established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] has guided AI research for most of its history.{{Efn
|[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about."{{Sfnp|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}}} The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly [[sub-symbolic]], [[soft computing|soft]] and [[artificial general intelligence|narrow]]. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.

====Symbolic AI and its limits====
[[Symbolic AI]] (or "[[GOFAI]]"){{Sfnp|Haugeland|1985|pp=112–117}} simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."<ref>Physical symbol system hypothesis: {{Harvtxt|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}

However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. [[Moravec's paradox]] is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.<ref>[[Moravec's paradox]]: {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}, {{Harvtxt|Minsky|1986|p=29}}, {{Harvtxt|Pinker|2007|pp=190–191}}</ref> Philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]] had [[Dreyfus' critique of AI|argued]] since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.<ref>[[Dreyfus' critique of AI]]: {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}

Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."{{Sfnp|Crevier|1993|p=125}}
}}<ref name="Psychological evidence of the prevalence of sub"/>

The issue is not resolved: [[sub-symbolic]] reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as [[algorithmic bias]]. Critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,{{Sfnp|Langley|2011}}{{Sfnp|Katz|2012}} in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from [[explainable AI]]: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of [[Neuro-symbolic AI|neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence]] attempts to bridge the two approaches.

==== Neat vs. scruffy ====
{{Main|Neats and scruffies}}
"Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]], [[optimization]], or [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]]). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,<ref>[[Neats vs. scruffies]], the historic debate: {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=421–424, 486–489}}, {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=168}}, {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1983|pp=10–11}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=24}}
A classic example of the "scruffy" approach to intelligence: {{Harvtxt|Minsky|1986}}
A modern example of neat AI and its aspirations in the 21st century: {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015}}</ref> but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.

==== Soft vs. hard computing ====
{{Main|Soft computing}}
Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] for many important problems.<ref name="Intractability and efficiency and the combinatorial explosion"/> Soft computing is a set of techniques, including [[genetic algorithms]], [[fuzzy logic]] and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.

==== Narrow vs. general AI ====
{{Main|Weak artificial intelligence|Artificial general intelligence}}
AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and [[superintelligence]] directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.{{Sfnp|Pennachin|Goertzel|2007}}{{Sfnp|Roberts|2016}} General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.

=== Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind ===
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Artificial consciousness}}
The [[philosophy of mind]] does not know whether a machine can have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]], in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Norvig]] add that "[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=986}} However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in [[artificial intelligence in fiction]].

==== Consciousness ====
{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}
[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.{{Sfnp|Chalmers|1995}} The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human [[Information processing (psychology)|information processing]] is easy to explain, human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to ''know what red looks like''.{{Sfnp|Dennett|1991}}

==== Computationalism and functionalism ====
{{Main|Computational theory of mind|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}

Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind–body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].{{Sfnp|Horst|2005}}

Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterized this position as "[[Strong AI hypothesis|strong AI]]": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."{{Efn|name="Searle's strong AI"|
Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999.{{Sfnp|Searle|1999}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{Sfnp|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Norvig]]: "Stong AI – the assertion that machines that do so are ''actually'' thinking (as opposed to ''simulating'' thinking)."{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=9817}}
}} Searle challenges this claim with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.<ref>Searle's [[Chinese room]] argument: {{Harvtxt|Searle|1980}}. Searle's original presentation of the thought experiment., {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}.

==== AI welfare and rights ====
It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced [[Sentient AI|AI is sentient]] (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leith |first=Sam |date=2022-07-07 |title=Nick Bostrom: How can we be certain a machine isn't conscious? |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/nick-bostrom-how-can-we-be-certain-a-machine-isnt-conscious |access-date=2024-02-23 |website=The Spectator |archive-date=26 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240926155639/https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/nick-bostrom-how-can-we-be-certain-a-machine-isnt-conscious/ |url-status=live }}</ref> But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.<ref name="Thomson-2022">{{Cite web |last=Thomson |first=Jonny |date=2022-10-31 |title=Why don't robots have rights? |url=https://bigthink.com/thinking/why-dont-robots-have-rights |access-date=2024-02-23 |website=Big Think |archive-date=13 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240913055336/https://bigthink.com/thinking/why-dont-robots-have-rights/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Kateman-2023">{{Cite magazine |last=Kateman |first=Brian |date=2023-07-24 |title=AI Should Be Terrified of Humans |url=https://time.com/6296234/ai-should-be-terrified-of-humans |access-date=2024-02-23 |magazine=Time |archive-date=25 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240925041601/https://time.com/6296234/ai-should-be-terrified-of-humans/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sapience]] (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or [[self-awareness]]) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.<ref name="Thomson-2022"/> [[Robot rights]] are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wong |first=Jeff |date=July 10, 2023 |title=What leaders need to know about robot rights |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90920769/what-leaders-need-to-know-about-robot-rights |work=Fast Company |ref=none}}</ref>

In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hern |first=Alex |date=2017-01-12 |title=Give robots 'personhood' status, EU committee argues |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/give-robots-personhood-status-eu-committee-argues |access-date=2024-02-23 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005171222/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/give-robots-personhood-status-eu-committee-argues |url-status=live }}</ref> Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of [[human rights]], and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios.

Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a [[Moral blindness|moral blind spot]] analogous to [[slavery]] or [[factory farming]], which could lead to [[Suffering risks|large-scale suffering]] if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.<ref name="Kateman-2023"/><ref name="Thomson-2022"/>

== Future ==
=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===<!--SUPERINTELLIGENCE-->

A [[superintelligence]] is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.{{Sfnp|Roberts|2016}}<!--SINGULARITY--> If research into [[artificial general intelligence]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to [[Recursive self-improvement|reprogram and improve itself]]. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what [[I. J. Good]] called an "[[intelligence explosion]]" and [[Vernor Vinge]] called a "[[Technological singularity|singularity]]".<ref>The [[Intelligence explosion]] and [[technological singularity]]: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1004–1005}}, {{Harvtxt|Omohundro|2008}}, {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}}

[[I. J. Good]]'s "intelligence explosion": {{Harvtxt|Good|1965}}

[[Vernor Vinge]]'s "singularity": {{Harvtxt|Vinge|1993}}</ref><!--ANTI-SINGULARITIANISM-->

However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an [[S-shaped curve]], slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.{{Sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1005}}

=== Transhumanism ===
{{Main|Transhumanism}}
<!-- TRANSHUMANISM -->
Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].<ref>[[Transhumanism]]: {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988}}, {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}}, {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1005}}</ref>

<!-- EVOLUTION / HUMAN REPLACEMENT -->
[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s "[[Darwin among the Machines]]" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his 1998 book ''[[Darwin Among the Machines#Evolution of Global Intelligence|Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence]]''.<ref>AI as evolution: [[Edward Fredkin]] is quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=401}}, {{Harvtxt|Butler|1863}}, {{Harvtxt|Dyson|1998}}</ref>

===Decomputing===
Arguments for ''decomputing'' have been raised by [[Dan McQuillan]] (''Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence'', 2022), meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence. Similar to [[degrowth]], the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. It argues that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries.<ref name="v935">{{cite web | last=McQuillan | first=Dan | title=a gift to the far right | website=ComputerWeekly.com | date=2025-01-14 | url=https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Labours-AI-Action-Plan-a-gift-to-the-far-right | access-date=2025-01-22}}</ref>

== In fiction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
[[File:Capek play.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The word "robot" itself was coined by [[Karel Čapek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots".]]

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,<ref name="AI in myth">AI in myth: {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=4–5}}</ref> and have been a persistent theme in [[science fiction]].{{Sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}

A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in these works began with [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|Arthur C. Clarke's]] and [[2001: A Space Odyssey|Stanley Kubrick's]] ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (both 1968), with [[HAL 9000]], the murderous computer in charge of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship, as well as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and Bishop from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.{{Sfnp|Buttazzo|2001}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] introduced the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] in many stories, most notably with the "[[Multivac]]" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;{{Sfnp|Anderson|2008}} while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.{{Sfnp|McCauley|2007}}

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer. This appears in [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the films ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', as well as the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.{{Sfnp|Galvan|1997}}

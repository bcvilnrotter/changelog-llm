'''Machine learning''' is a field of [[artificial intelligence]] related to [[Data Mining]] and [[Statistics]]. It involves learning from data. The researcher feeds a set of training examples to a computer program that aims to learn the connection between features of the examples and a specified target concept. The program might be fed information about the financial profiles of a group of credit card customers whose credit history is known, with the aim of learning about cues that predict when a particular customer is likely to default on a loan. Once training is complete, the algorithm would be used to make predictions about whether new and unseen customers are likely to default.
